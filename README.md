# Project â„–2: How to learn.

### Used technologes:
* The file structure is made according to the rules of Nested BEM
* The sections are laid out using flexbox, absolute positioning
* The animation realised by pseudo-classes and keyframes 
* YouTube API and iframes
* Vendor prefixes so that the page is universal for different devices

**Description**

This is a training project representing my skills in landing pages develop.

Page divided into several sections each reveals its separate aspect.
The information is collected in an intuitive, minimalistic way, you can find here useful links, learning resources and more.

Perhaps I will also add a feedback form to the page through which users can submit their comments.
